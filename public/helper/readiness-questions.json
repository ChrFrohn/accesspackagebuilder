        "explanation": "To implement Access Packages effectively, it’s important that the necessary roles within your organization are clearly defined. This includes identifying who is responsible for approving access requests, managing the packages, maintaining group memberships, and conducting regular access reviews. Without this clarity, the access management process can become inconsistent, inefficient, or non-compliant.",

        "explanation": "To manage access effectively with Access Packages, it’s essential to have a clear understanding of your organizational structure including departments, business units, service areas, and physical or regional locations. These structures are often used in dynamic group rules, attribute-based assignments, or policy scopes, so missing or unclear structure data can lead to incorrect access or manual overhead.",

        "explanation": "Understanding your organization's compliance requirements (such as ISO 27001, GDPR, SOX, etc.) is critical for identity and access governance. It’s equally important to know who is responsible for reviewing whether access controls and user permissions meet those standards. This ensures that access packages and entitlement management are aligned with both security policies and audit expectations.",
