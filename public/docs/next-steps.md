# ðŸ”œ Next Steps

This solution is focused specifically on Access Packages,
simplifying this critical part of your Identity Governance process.
By automating and optimizing how access is managed across your
organization, the Access Package Builder helps ensure that the right
users receive the right permissions with minimal effort.

However, this is just the beginning! There are many more features
within the Identity Governance suite that can further enhance
security, compliance, and operational efficiency. Stay tuned for
upcoming tools and updates that will help you take your Identity
Governance to the next level.

We are constantly working to provide more capabilities that will
streamline your user access management, so keep an eye out for
exciting new features to come!
