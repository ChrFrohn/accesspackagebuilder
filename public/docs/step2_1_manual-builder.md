# Step 2.1: Manual Access Package Builder

On this page, you can create your Access Packages based on a Group
Selection. Each group displayed will show the number of members,
making it easier for you to decide where to place the group (in
which category: Default, Company, or Department).

## 🔽 Using the Manual Builder

The group selection dropdown lists all available groups. Each group
also displays the member count and group type, which can help you
decide where to assign the group:

- **Default:**
  Groups that are for all users in my
  organization.
- **Company:**
  Groups that belong to a specific
  company.
- **Department:**
  Groups that belong to a specific
  department.


> 📸 Per Drag and Drop create your Access Packages!

## 🔎 Group Membership Analyzer

If you're unsure about a group, there’s a built-in
Group Membership Analyzer located
below the group list. This analyzer helps you better understand the
group by displaying detailed information about its members.

For each group, you can view the following details about its
members:

- **accountEnabled:**
  Whether the user's account is
  enabled or not (e.g., ✔️ Enabled, ❌ Disabled).
- **userType:**
  The type of user (e.g.,
  Member, Guest).
- **Department:**
  The department the user belongs to.
- **officeLocation:**
  The physical office location of
  the user.
- **Country:**
  The country in which the user resides.
- **CompanyName:**
  The company the user belongs to.

Package, or Department Access Package. By using the Manual Builder
and Group Membership Analyzer features, you can efficiently
categorize your groups and assign them to the appropriate Access
Package. This process ensures that your groups are well-organized
